Absolutely, Emanuele — you can design your base and derived classes so that **some events are handled by the base class**, while others are **overridden in derived classes**. This is a classic use case for polymorphism combined with selective overriding.

Let me show you how to structure it elegantly.

## 🧱 Base Class with Default Event Handling

```cpp
class MqttHandlerBase {
public:
    // Virtual method with default implementation
    virtual void handle_event(esp_event_base_t base, int32_t id, void* event_data) {
        printf("[Base] Handling event ID %d\n", id);
        // Default logic for generic or unhandled events
    }

    // Static handler registered with ESP-IDF
    static void mqtt_event_handler(void* handler_args,
                                   esp_event_base_t base,
                                   int32_t id,
                                   void* event_data) {
        auto* instance = static_cast<MqttHandlerBase*>(handler_args);
        instance->handle_event(base, id, event_data); // Virtual dispatch
    }

    virtual ~MqttHandlerBase() = default;
};
```

📝 **Key Point**: `handle_event` is no longer pure virtual (`= 0`). It has a default implementation that derived classes can optionally override.

## 🧬 Derived Class with Selective Overrides

```cpp
class MyMqttHandler : public MqttHandlerBase {
public:
    void handle_event(esp_event_base_t base, int32_t id, void* event_data) override {
        switch (id) {
            case MQTT_EVENT_CONNECTED:
                printf("[Derived] Connected to MQTT broker\n");
                // Custom logic for connection
                break;

            case MQTT_EVENT_DATA:
                printf("[Derived] Received MQTT data\n");
                // Custom logic for data
                break;

            default:
                // Delegate unhandled events to base class
                MqttHandlerBase::handle_event(base, id, event_data);
                break;
        }
    }
};
```

📝 **Key Point**: The derived class overrides `handle_event`, but selectively delegates unknown or generic events back to the base class using `MqttHandlerBase::handle_event(...)`.

## 🔗 Registration (unchanged)

```cpp
MyMqttHandler* handler_instance = new MyMqttHandler();

esp_event_handler_register(MQTT_EVENT, ESP_EVENT_ANY_ID,
                           &MqttHandlerBase::mqtt_event_handler,
                           handler_instance);
```

## ✅ Benefits of This Design

- 🔄 **Flexible override**: Derived classes can handle only the events they care about.
- 🧼 **Clean fallback**: Base class provides a default behavior for everything else.
- 🧩 **Extensible**: You can add more derived classes with different override strategies.

If you want to take it even further, you could use a `std::map<int32_t, std::function<void(...)>>` inside the derived class to register handlers per event ID — almost like a mini dispatcher. Want me to sketch that out for you?
