### ðŸ§  Option 2: Hook into ESP-IDF Logging System

If you want to intercept all `ESP_LOGx` calls, you can register a custom log handler:

```cpp
esp_log_set_vprintf(my_mqtt_log_handler);
```

Your handler would look like:

```cpp
int my_mqtt_log_handler(const char* format, va_list args) {
    char buffer[256];
    vsnprintf(buffer, sizeof(buffer), format, args);
    mqtt_log("ESP", buffer);
    return vprintf(format, args); // Optional: still print to serial
}
```

This way, every log message gets mirrored to MQTT.

### ðŸ§ª Tips for Reliability

- **Throttle logs**: Avoid flooding the broker with high-frequency logs.
- **Use QoS 1**: Ensures delivery without overwhelming the broker.
- **Add timestamps**: Helps correlate events across devices.

Let me know if you want to filter logs by severity, or route them to different topics (e.g., `device/errors`, `device/debug`). Youâ€™re building a seriously slick monitoring setup.
